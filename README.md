Newsbook is a dynamic and user-friendly news application designed to keep users informed with curated content across various categories such as sports, entertainment, general, business, and more. The application fetches news from a reliable API, ensuring a broad range of topics and accurate information.

Due to API restrictions, the news displayed is delayed by one day, which makes Newsbook an excellent tool for users seeking a well-organized summary of the previous day's major events. The intuitive categorization ensures that users can effortlessly navigate and explore their areas of interest, making Newsbook a practical and engaging platform for staying updated.
